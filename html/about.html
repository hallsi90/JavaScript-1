      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our company was founded in 1999 by a group of outdoor enthusiasts who
        recognized the need for high-quality rain gear that could withstand the
        toughest weather conditions. We were inspired to create a line of rain
        jackets that were not only functional but also stylish and comfortable
        to wear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, we have gained a reputation for excellence in the
        industry, and we're recognized as one of the leading rain jacket
        retailers in the market. We've accomplished this through our commitment
        to quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction.
